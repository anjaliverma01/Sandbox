The yield term comes from a probability the candidate would accept an offer: [ p_{ij} = !((t_j - q_i) + s_{ij})] where () is logistic; if (q_i t_j), then (p_{ij}) is small (dept thinks “they won’t accept”). (s_{ij}) is a signal bump if candidate signals interest.\nOffer stage (two variants): Decentralized/early offers: departments make offers to top interviewees; candidates may accept quickly, leaving congestion and mismatch. Centralized match (Deferred Acceptance / NRMP-style): stable matching on preferences after interviews.\n\nKey levers: signal_slots (credible interest signals), mechanism (\"decentralized\" vs \"da\"), and interviews per dept K. Yield sensitivity comes from alpha (steepness) and lam (weight on yield)."

    "text": "What we should typically see (qualitatively)\nWith parameters like alpha≈2 (steep yield drop when candidate is “overqualified”) and a meaningful lam (departments care about yield), you’ll usually observe: - Bad equilibrium (decentralized, no signals): - Mid-tier departments interview fewer top candidates (mid_depts_interview_top10_share low). - Some high-quality candidates get stranded (stranded_top20_share non-trivial). - Match quality correlation can be weaker than expected, and/or fill rates can be worse. - Better outcomes with: 1. Centralized DA: reduces “exploding offers” and congestion; candidates don’t have to accept early and lose better options. 2. Limited signals: gives mid-tier departments a credible way to distinguish “top candidate who might actually accept” from “top candidate using us as a safety/throwaway.” 3. More interviews (higher K): reduces the interview bottleneck that amplifies errors from yield-guessing."
